# Material Gaze

A clean and minimal child theme for the [Stargazer](http://wordpress.org/themes/stargazer) parent theme. This child theme uses a thinner font to completely transform how its parent theme looks.  It offers an alternative color scheme and comes packaged with additional backgrounds to use with the WordPress custom background feature.
